            <p class="article__text article__text--bold">Circular economy solutions can help us resolve the climate crisis – why aren’t we all talking about them? We continue to see extensive media coverage on the destructive impact that climate crisis is having on our environment, yet there is still little airtime given to solutions such as the circular economy.</p>

            <p class="article__text">The need for immediate and meaningful action to tackle the climate change has been highlighted by the November 2019 WMO Bulletin which showed that levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere reached another record high in 2018 at 407.8 parts per million with no signs of a slowdown. Countries will have to increase their carbon-cutting ambitions five-fold if the world is to avoid warming by more than 1.5C.</p>

            <p class="article__text">Yet there is hope. The Swedish sustainability consultancy <a href="#" class="article__link">Material Economics</a> undertook extensive research into climate change mitigation and concluded that circular economy measures could reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the four key value chains of the steel, plastics, aluminium and cement industries by 56 per cent. However, the Circularity Gap Report 2019 found only 9 per cent of our world is circular and worse, resource extraction and greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, with the linear economy becoming more entrenched globally.</p>

            <p class="article__text">I first learnt about the circular economy when I was choosing a subject for my Master’s dissertation at the Institute of Development Studies in 2015. I did my research in South Africa on the challenges of creating a circular approach to managing electronic waste streams. As I wrote my paper, I wondered how a circular mindset could produce significant improvement in the lives of people in <a href="#" class="article__link">emerging economies</a>, particularly as climate change tends to hit the poorest communities hardest. It made me start to ask the question, “How can circular principles solve the climate and ecological crisis that we are currently experiencing?”.</p>

            <h2 class="article__sub-header">Circular Thinking and the Climate Crisis</h2>
            
            <p class="article__text">I have seen how much the climate crisis features on the agenda of international conferences. A recent example is from the <a href="#" class="article__link">World Resources Forum in Geneva in October 2019</a> – in the final plenary, Lieze Cloots, of the Public Waste Agency of Flanders, rounded up the five key messages from the conference: the first was “the Circular Economy is an enabler for climate policy”. I am sure we will see more discussions like this at COP25 in Madrid in 2019 and as we prepare for COP26 in Glasgow in 2020.</p>

            <p class="article__text">By 2030, the world is aiming to achieve the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Two papers I have been reading by <a href="#" class="article__link">Patrick Schroeder</a> and Chatham House make a strong link between circular practices and the SDGs, especially:</p>

            <ul class="article__list">
                <li>SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation</li>
                <li>SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy</li>
                <li>SDG 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth</li>
                <li>SDG 12 Responsible Consumption and Production</li>
                <li>SDG 15 Life on Land.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="article__text">The importance of these links was highlighted in 2018 by Kate Raworth, when she mapped her Doughnut Economics framework onto the <a href="#" class="article__link">SDGs</a>, highlighting gaps between the SDG aims and the need to stay below the environmental ceiling, thus creating a safe and just space for the world to live in. Yet there didn’t seem to be a clear indication that Goal 13 (Climate Action) could benefit from circular thinking.</p>

            <h2 class="article__sub-header">Circular, positive solutions</h2>
            <p class="article__text">I believe the circular economy is an essential tool in mitigating the negative impacts of the climate and ecological crisis. We in the Global North need to do more than anyone, given that we created the problem in the first place. It doesn’t feel helpful to say “Climate change is inevitable, we can’t do anything to stop it, we just need to plan for the worst disaster”. Instead, I believe we can all make a positive impact by helping to implement a circular economy – to engage in conversation with those around us, lobby people in power and take circular actions in our businesses and homes. Moving away from our current linear economy and reducing carbon emissions will improve prosperity, enhance business reputations, and create healthier lifestyles for ourselves and our planet.</p>
